  * @author  MCD Application Team
  * @version V4.2.0
  * @date    31-March-2017
  * @brief   CMSIS Cortex-M3 Device Peripheral Access Layer System Source File.
  * 
  * 1.  This file provides two functions and one global variable to be called from 
  *     user application:
  *      - SystemInit(): Setups the system clock (System clock source, PLL Multiplier
  *                      factors, AHB/APBx prescalers and Flash settings). 
  *                      This function is called at startup just after reset and 
  *                      before branch to main program. This call is made inside
  *                      the "startup_stm32f1xx_xx.s" file.
  *
  *      - SystemCoreClock variable: Contains the core clock (HCLK), it can be used
  *                                  by the user application to setup the SysTick 
  *                                  timer or configure other parameters.
  *                                     
  *      - SystemCoreClockUpdate(): Updates the variable SystemCoreClock and must
  *                                 be called whenever the core clock is changed
  *                                 during program execution.
  *
  * 2. After each device reset the HSI (8 MHz) is used as system clock source.
  *    Then SystemInit() function is called, in "startup_stm32f1xx_xx.s" file, to
  *    configure the system clock before to branch to main program.
  *
  * 4. The default value of HSE crystal is set to 8 MHz (or 25 MHz, depending on
  *    the product used), refer to "HSE_VALUE". 
  *    When HSE is used as system clock source, directly or through PLL, and you
  *    are using different crystal you have to adapt the HSE value to your own
  *    configuration.
  *

  * @brief  Update SystemCoreClock variable according to Clock Register Values.
  *         The SystemCoreClock variable contains the core clock (HCLK), it can
  *         be used by the user application to setup the SysTick timer or configure
  *         other parameters.
  *           
  * @note   Each time the core clock (HCLK) changes, this function must be called
  *         to update SystemCoreClock variable value. Otherwise, any configuration
  *         based on this variable will be incorrect.         
  *     
  * @note   - The system frequency computed by this function is not the real 
  *           frequency in the chip. It is calculated based on the predefined 
  *           constant and the selected clock source:
  *             
  *           - If SYSCLK source is HSI, SystemCoreClock will contain the HSI_VALUE(*)
  *                                              
  *           - If SYSCLK source is HSE, SystemCoreClock will contain the HSE_VALUE(**)
  *                          
  *           - If SYSCLK source is PLL, SystemCoreClock will contain the HSE_VALUE(**) 
  *             or HSI_VALUE(*) multiplied by the PLL factors.
  *         
  *         (*) HSI_VALUE is a constant defined in stm32f1xx.h file (default value
  *             8 MHz) but the real value may vary depending on the variations
  *             in voltage and temperature.   
  *    
  *         (**) HSE_VALUE is a constant defined in stm32f1xx.h file (default value
  *              8 MHz or 25 MHz, depending on the product used), user has to ensure
  *              that HSE_VALUE is same as the real frequency of the crystal used.
  *              Otherwise, this function may have wrong result.
  *                
  *         - The result of this function could be not correct when using fractional
  *           value for HSE crystal.
